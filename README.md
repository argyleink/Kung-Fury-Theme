# Kung Fury
| Hackerman says "by far the best retro code theme"

## Features
- This theme accentuates the signal of your code, while pushing back the noise
- Colors, italics, and subdued colors are all meaningfully applied to help you understand the code
- Lets you write to spec, but if all the code is proper, then it looks pythonic
- Pics coming soon!
